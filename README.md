## STEP 1 - Identify Your Goals
To create a perfectly tailored weight training program that suits your needs, you must first clearly define your objectives:
  - Reshape your body
  - Get rid of excess body fat
  - Improve your sport performance
  - Remain healthy
  - Fight the loss of mobility due to aging

## STEP 2 - Decide How Many Days Per Week to Train
## STEP 3 - Choose Your Training Days
To progress quickly, follow this one main rule: One day of weight training has to be followed by at least one day of rest from weight training (so doing a cardio workout the day after a weight training session is a possibility). Cardio training has fewer constraints because it does not traumatize the body nearly as much as weight training does. 
## STEP 4 - Decide Whether to Train More Than Once Per Day
We strongly advise not to weight train twice a day. Ideally, cardio can be performed on days you do not weight train. But it is conceivable to do cardio in the morning and weight training later in the day. Alternatively, you can weight train in the morning and do cardio at night. 
## STEP 5 - Choose Your Training Time
Is it better to train in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, or in the evening?
ANSWER: Scientific studies have shown that muscle strength and endurance vary throughout the day. Most women are stronger in the afternoon and weaker in the morning. The body is a little bit colder in the morning, and it slowly warms up with time and as a result of eating. This slight elevation in temperature is associated with an increase in central nervous system efficiency. Therefore, muscle power rises in parallel with body temperature. Training whenever your muscles are at their strongest is ideal, which for most woman this peak performance occurs in the afternoon.
## STEP 5 - Choose an Order in Which to Work the Muscles in Each Session
Training your whole body in one workout would be cumbersome. There are six major body regions which must be trainned:
1. Legs (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves)
2. Abdomen
3. Back
4. Chest
5. Arms (biceps and triceps)
6. Shoulders

The following four tips can help you design your program:
1. Take full advantage of the indirect work.
2. Rate the importance of each muscle according to your goals.
3. Focus on your weak areas.
4. Use the rotation principle.
