# Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy
Part reference, part exercise, this books is a manual with helpful hints and facts. It includes beautiful drawings to guide you how to exercise your muscles and in which order. Overall this is a complete manual for someone looking to get health benefits and enhance their appearance as well.

## PART 1 - 20 Steps to Creating a Personalized Program
> Creating your own program involves 20 steps, described below. They will give you the answers you need to start training with a program
>that best matches your goals.
>The 20 steps outlined here combine resistance training and cardio training.
>You may have decided that you want to perform only resistance training. However, if you have fat to lose or have difficulty maintaining >your body weight, it
>is wise to add some cardio training. Stretching regularly to maintain flexibility
>as well as good posture is also important, especially given that it requires only
>a few minutes per week.Rest assured that as long as you are training regularly and eating a balanced, healthy diet, fat will diminish and muscles will develop.

## STEP 1 - Identify Your Goals
To create a perfectly tailored weight training program that suits your needs, you must first clearly define your objectives:
  - Reshape your body
  - Get rid of excess body fat
  - Improve your sport performance
  - Remain healthy
  - Fight the loss of mobility due to aging

## STEP 2 - Decide How Many Days Per Week to Train
For the various schedules, here are the options:
  - One weekly weight training session: This schedule does not pose any recovery issues, and weight training can be done on any day.
  - Two weekly weight training sessions: Separate workouts as much as possible (e.g., Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday), but at a minimum, try to respect the pattern of one workout and one day of rest. 
  - Three weekly weight training sessions: With this schedule, respecting the one-workout-one-day-of-rest pattern is difficult, but still possible. Try to balance your week as much as possibleâ€”for example, by weight training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
 - Four weekly weight training sessions: With such a high training frequency, properly spacing the workouts to provide your body with enough rest is difficult. Whenever you perform two workouts without rest between them, make sure that one targets your upper body and the other targets your lower body.
## STEP 3 - Choose Your Training Days
To progress quickly, follow this one main rule: One day of weight training has to be followed by at least one day of rest from weight training (so doing a cardio workout the day after a weight training session is a possibility). Cardio training has fewer constraints because it does not traumatize the body nearly as much as weight training does. 
## STEP 4 - Decide Whether to Train More Than Once Per Day
We strongly advise not to weight train twice a day. Ideally, cardio can be performed on days you do not weight train. But it is conceivable to do cardio in the morning and weight training later in the day. Alternatively, you can weight train in the morning and do cardio at night. 
## STEP 5 - Choose Your Training Time
Is it better to train in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, or in the evening?
ANSWER: Scientific studies have shown that muscle strength and endurance vary throughout the day. Most women are stronger in the afternoon and weaker in the morning. The body is a little bit colder in the morning, and it slowly warms up with time and as a result of eating. This slight elevation in temperature is associated with an increase in central nervous system efficiency. Therefore, muscle power rises in parallel with body temperature. Training whenever your muscles are at their strongest is ideal, which for most woman this peak performance occurs in the afternoon.
## STEP 6 - Choose an Order in Which to Work the Muscles in Each Session
Training your whole body in one workout would be cumbersome. There are six major body regions which must be trainned:
1. Legs (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves)
2. Abdomen
3. Back
4. Chest
5. Arms (biceps and triceps)
6. Shoulders

The following four tips can help you design your program:
1. Take full advantage of the indirect work.
Always train your arms before your back or chest. This results in the biceps or triceps being too tired to handle the weight necessary to stimulate the chest and the back. The same goes for your legs. Training your calves first will tire them and decrease
your strength for the basic leg exercises. Furthermore, the quadriceps and hamstring exercises provide enough indirect calf stimulation to render direct lower-leg exercises superfluous in many cases.
2. Rate the importance of each muscle according to your goals.
If you want chiseled abdominal muscles, you can begin each workout with abdominal exercises as a warm-up.
3. Focus on your weak areas.
4. Use the rotation principle.
## STEP 7 - Schedule Your Body Regions for Each Workout
If you want to make quick progress in strength and body shaping, the best thing to do is to work each muscle group twice a week.
> Four Weekly Weight Training Workouts:
#### Workout 1
 - **Lower body**: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 2
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, shoulders, and back
 - **Lower body**: glutes
#### Workout 3
 - **Lower body**: glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 4
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, chest, and arms
 - **Lower body**: hamstrings
## STEP 8 - Determine How Many Exercises to do Per Body Region
## STEP 9 -Choose the Number of Sets Per Muscle Group
For aesthetic purposes, muscles can artificially be divided into the following
three major categories:
1. Most important muscles: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
2. Complex muscles: back, shoulders, and abdominals
3. Less important muscles: chest, biceps, triceps, forearms, and calves
Beginners should aim for the following totals:
 - Two or three sets for each of the most important muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One set for each of the less important muscles
After a couple months of training, you should aim for the following:
 - Three or four sets for each of the most important muscles 
 - Two or three sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the less important muscles
After six months of training, you should aim for the following totals:
 - Four or five sets for each of the most important muscles
 - Three or four sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One to three sets for each of the less important muscles
 
## STEP 10 - Choose the Number of Repetitions Per Set
How many times (repetitions) should you perform an exercise in each set? 
- For muscle toning, it is best to do from 10 to 20 repetitions with heavier weights. 
- To burn calories and fat and to improve your cardiovascular health, do at least 30 repetitions, and up to 50, with lighter weights.
##### Use the three set rule: 
   - Once your muscles are fully warmed up, start with a light weight and a high number of repetitions (e.g., 20) for the first set.        - For the second set increase the weight enough so that you can perform only 12 to 15 repetitions. However, do not stop during a set (except for the warm-up) because you have reached your repetition goal. If you were shooting for 12 reps but could do 16,go ahead and do them! 
   - For the third set, add weight so that you can perform only 10 repetitions.
