# Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy
Part reference, part exercise, this books is a manual with helpful hints and facts. It includes beautiful drawings to guide you how to exercise your muscles and in which order. Overall this is a complete manual for someone looking to get health benefits and enhance their appearance as well.

## PART 1 - 20 Steps to Creating a Personalized Program
> Creating your own program involves 20 steps, described below. They will give you the answers you need to start training with a program
>that best matches your goals.
>The 20 steps outlined here combine resistance training and cardio training.
>You may have decided that you want to perform only resistance training. However, if you have fat to lose or have difficulty maintaining >your body weight, it
>is wise to add some cardio training. Stretching regularly to maintain flexibility
>as well as good posture is also important, especially given that it requires only
>a few minutes per week.Rest assured that as long as you are training regularly and eating a balanced, healthy diet, fat will diminish and muscles will develop.

## STEP 1 - Identify Your Goals
To create a perfectly tailored weight training program that suits your needs, you must first clearly define your objectives:
  - Reshape your body
  - Get rid of excess body fat
  - Improve your sport performance
  - Remain healthy
  - Fight the loss of mobility due to aging

## STEP 2 - Decide How Many Days Per Week to Train
For the various schedules, here are the options:
  - One weekly weight training session: This schedule does not pose any recovery issues, and weight training can be done on any day.
  - Two weekly weight training sessions: Separate workouts as much as possible (e.g., Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday), but at a minimum, try to respect the pattern of one workout and one day of rest. 
  - Three weekly weight training sessions: With this schedule, respecting the one-workout-one-day-of-rest pattern is difficult, but still possible. Try to balance your week as much as possible—for example, by weight training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
 - Four weekly weight training sessions: With such a high training frequency, properly spacing the workouts to provide your body with enough rest is difficult. Whenever you perform two workouts without rest between them, make sure that one targets your upper body and the other targets your lower body.
## STEP 3 - Choose Your Training Days
To progress quickly, follow this one main rule: One day of weight training has to be followed by at least one day of rest from weight training (so doing a cardio workout the day after a weight training session is a possibility). Cardio training has fewer constraints because it does not traumatize the body nearly as much as weight training does. 
## STEP 4 - Decide Whether to Train More Than Once Per Day
We strongly advise not to weight train twice a day. Ideally, cardio can be performed on days you do not weight train. But it is conceivable to do cardio in the morning and weight training later in the day. Alternatively, you can weight train in the morning and do cardio at night. 
## STEP 5 - Choose Your Training Time
Is it better to train in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, or in the evening?
ANSWER: Scientific studies have shown that muscle strength and endurance vary throughout the day. Most women are stronger in the afternoon and weaker in the morning. The body is a little bit colder in the morning, and it slowly warms up with time and as a result of eating. This slight elevation in temperature is associated with an increase in central nervous system efficiency. Therefore, muscle power rises in parallel with body temperature. Training whenever your muscles are at their strongest is ideal, which for most woman this peak performance occurs in the afternoon.
## STEP 6 - Choose an Order in Which to Work the Muscles in Each Session
Training your whole body in one workout would be cumbersome. There are six major body regions which must be trainned:
1. Legs (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves)
2. Abdomen
3. Back
4. Chest
5. Arms (biceps and triceps)
6. Shoulders

The following four tips can help you design your program:
1. Take full advantage of the indirect work.
Always train your arms before your back or chest. This results in the biceps or triceps being too tired to handle the weight necessary to stimulate the chest and the back. The same goes for your legs. Training your calves first will tire them and decrease
your strength for the basic leg exercises. Furthermore, the quadriceps and hamstring exercises provide enough indirect calf stimulation to render direct lower-leg exercises superfluous in many cases.
2. Rate the importance of each muscle according to your goals.
If you want chiseled abdominal muscles, you can begin each workout with abdominal exercises as a warm-up.
3. Focus on your weak areas.
4. Use the rotation principle.
## STEP 7 - Schedule Your Body Regions for Each Workout
If you want to make quick progress in strength and body shaping, the best thing to do is to work each muscle group twice a week.
> Four Weekly Weight Training Workouts:
#### Workout 1
 - **Lower body**: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 2
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, shoulders, and back
 - **Lower body**: glutes
#### Workout 3
 - **Lower body**: glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 4
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, chest, and arms
 - **Lower body**: hamstrings
## STEP 8 - Determine How Many Exercises to do Per Body Region
## STEP 9 -Choose the Number of Sets Per Muscle Group
For aesthetic purposes, muscles can artificially be divided into the following
three major categories:
1. Most important muscles: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
2. Complex muscles: back, shoulders, and abdominals
3. Less important muscles: chest, biceps, triceps, forearms, and calves
Beginners should aim for the following totals:
 - Two or three sets for each of the most important muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One set for each of the less important muscles
After a couple months of training, you should aim for the following:
 - Three or four sets for each of the most important muscles 
 - Two or three sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the less important muscles
After six months of training, you should aim for the following totals:
 - Four or five sets for each of the most important muscles
 - Three or four sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One to three sets for each of the less important muscles
 
## STEP 10 - Choose the Number of Repetitions Per Set
How many times (repetitions) should you perform an exercise in each set? 
- For muscle toning, it is best to do from 10 to 20 repetitions with heavier weights. 
- To burn calories and fat and to improve your cardiovascular health, do at least 30 repetitions, and up to 50, with lighter weights.
##### Use the three set rule: 
   - Once your muscles are fully warmed up, start with a light weight and a high number of repetitions (e.g., 20) for the first set.        - For the second set increase the weight enough so that you can perform only 12 to 15 repetitions.
   - For the third set, add weight so that you can perform only 10 repetitions.
## STEP 11 - Decide How Long Your Workout Should Last
How much time should you devote to each workout? 
 - This issue is very important not only to get fast results but also, and more important, to be able to stick to your program. You do not want to use too long a workout as an excuse not to go to the gym. A brief workout is much better than no workout at all.
 - The objective of a good workout is to stimulate muscles to their maximum in the shortest time possible. What you should look for are strategies that increase a workout’s intensity rather than its length.
A good weight training workout lasts at least 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 45 minutes. If you spend more than one hour working out, your effort is not intense enough. At the end of 30 to 45 minutes, your muscles should be begging for mercy.
The duration of your workout depends on two things:
1. Volume of work (number of exercises plus number of sets)
2. Rest time between sets

Do not weight train for more than an hour because this means that you are doing one, or a combination, of the following:
 - Working too many muscles per session
 - Doing too many exercises
 - Doing too many sets
 - Taking too much rest time between sets
## STEP 12 - Learn the Proper Speed for Each Repetition
The speed of your repetitions is a very important factor in the success of your program. Do not lift a weight with too much speed by using momentum and body swings instead of your own muscle strength. If you are just starting weight lifting, use a deliberate tempo rather than an explosive motion. You will quickly realize that a slower motion is more excruciating than a fast one. You use your muscles much more when you lift a weight up and down slowly, which is exactly what you want.
We recommend that you take two or three seconds to raise a weight and atleast as much time, if not slightly more, to lower it. The weaker your muscles are, the slower each repetition should be performed. Raise the weight in five seconds and lower it in three to five seconds. 
## STEP 13 -Determine How Long to Rest Between Sets\
Consider your rest time between sets as a tool to help you reach your goal faster. If you mainly wish to sculpt your muscles, you need to rest long enough so that you recover most of your strength. On the other hand, you do not want to rest so much that your workout loses its intensity despite the heavier weight. If your goal is mainly to burn fat, do not rest much. Following are good between-set resting guidelines:
 - To tone up, 30 to 45 seconds of rest should suffice. 
 - To burn calories and fat, you should adopt a faster pace with only 10 to 20 seconds of rest between sets. As you progress, reduce this resting time to a bare minimum. 
Research has shown that women performing a similar workload as men produce less lactic acid and experience a lower elevation of heart rate. Therefore, we require less rest than men do between sets.
## STEP 14 - Avoid Rest Time Between Two Different Exercises
Avoid wasting time when changing exercises. The time required to move from one machine to the next and adjust the seat or the weight (or both) provides enough rest. You might even have to wait for someone to finish a set. Do not add this compulsory wait time to a voluntary rest you just took. Moving fast burns both more calories and more fat while cutting down on the time you spend in the gym.
## STEP 15 - Pick the Proper Weight for Each Exercise
Start with a resistance that seems too light to be challenging for your muscles. This easy set will serve as a first warm-up.
For your real first working set, increase the resistance even more. For your second working set, you might increase the resistance slightly more to render the movement more challenging. It is very helpful to note each of your weights as well as the number of repetitions you performed for each exercise in a notebook or in your phone. There are plenty of apps for this.
## STEP 16 - Know When to Increase Resistance
If you scrupulously note all your workouts as suggested, you will easily figure outwhen to increase your weight for your next workout. If you do not write down your weight, you will face a very tedious task.
#### As a rule of thumb:
 - If you performed more repetitions than expected for an exercise in your last workout, pick up a slightly heavier weight today.
 - If you perform fewer repetitions than expected for an exercise in your last workout, use the same amount of resistance until you feel very comfortable with that weight.
## STEP 17 - Choose Exercises That Suit Your Morphology
Everybody's morphology is unique in terms of height and the length of torso, legs, and arms. Some exercises force us to adopt unnatural positions, whereas others feel very natural to us. If a movement places you in an uncomfortable position, eliminate it from your routine. When you start lifting, stick to movements that you feel your build is designed to perform safely. 
As a rule of thumb, the taller you are, the more dangerous the basic free weight exercises will be because you have to go through
a much greater range of motion. This is typically true of the squat and the chest press. By the same token, body weight exercises such as push-ups are likely to be more traumatic for your joints, also because of this greater range of motion.
#### Machines Versus Free Weights - Which is more effective?
The two main kinds of resistance in weight training are free weights (dumbbells and bar) and machines. Hamstrings, are difficult to train without machines. On the other hand, free weights are more appropriate for biceps. For this reason, a combination of both is best. It is a common belief in the gym that free weights are more effective than machines. This is simply not true. The most effective way to make progress is to use machines whenever they are more appropriate than free weights, and free weights whenever they are
more appropriate than machines. Beginner should use machines machines, because they are typically much easier to master and better guide your movement as you learn the exerciseMany new machines provide quick response (QR) codes that allow you to view a video of how to use the machine on your smartphone. You do not have to rely on anyone to demonstrate the proper use of the equipment. Of course,
there is no such QR code on free weights. Women starting weight lifting are more likely to make better progress with machines than with free weights. As you progress, you can move on to more complex, free weight exercises. They will be easier then because your muscles will have gotten used to the workout. Starting directly with free weight movement is more complicated because it involves motor learning that will slow down your gains of muscle strength.
#### There are Two Major Exercise Subcategories
All movements, can be divided into two major categories: 
 - basic and multiple-joint exercises;
 - isolated and single-joint exercises.
1. Basic, multiple-joint exercises: Whenever more than one joint is flexed, the exercise is classified as a basic, multiple-joint exercise. For example, in a leg lunge, the knees, ankles, and hips are mobilized. Basic movements are more demanding than isolated movements, and they save time in your workout by working multiple muscles, but they are more complex to master.
2. Isolated, single-joint exercises: Whenever only one joint is flexed, the exercise is classified as an isolated, single-joint exercise. For example, in the leg extension, only the knees are mobilized. Because of the lesser demand on the body, isolated movements are easier to perform than basic, multiple-joint ones. However, because they recruit fewer muscles groups, they are less effective in terms of strength gains and calorie expenditure. 
## STEP 18 - Recognize When It’s Time to Change Your Program
Maintain the same training program for as long as you are making gains on it. Once you are familiar with weight training, feel free to change your exercises as frequently as you wish because there are few learning curves as you introduce new movements.
## STEP 19 - Take a Break
If you go on a vacation or feel as though you need a break, it is fine to stop training for one or two weeks. But remember that when you stop working out, you do not burn as many calories; if you do not watch your diet, you might accumulate fat easily.
## STEP 20 - Maintain Your Gains
Maintaining muscle gain is easier than acquiring it. If strength increases rapidly as you first start training, its reduction occurs quickly if you stop working out for a while. Muscle shape is more resistant to a long rest period, which demonstrates that the reduction of strength is mainly due to a temporary weakening of the nervous signals. Your peak strength will return to its maximum within a couple weeks of training.

#### How do you increase the intesity of your trainning? 
- The most obvious are adding weight and increasing the number of repetitions. These techniques use the overload principle. Both are excellent ways to put more stress on the muscles, but they also place more tension on the joints and ligaments;

## Techniques to increase the level of training intensity without traumatizing your joints:
##### Muscle Burn
As your set progresses, your muscles feel as if they are burning. As you perform more and more repetitions, the intensity of this burn amplifies. This painful sensation is caused by the accumulation of waste known as lactic acid that gets trapped in the working muscles. The muscle burn pain is a signal that you are pushing your muscles past what they are accustomed to. As a result, they have to become stronger and more resistant, which also translates into increased muscle definition. Because it makes you uncomfortable, lactic acid may seem like an enemy. One goal of weight training is to turn this obstacle around and transform it into an opportunity for progression. Your main concern should be to learn how to generate and tolerate as much muscle burn as possible. Trying to achieve more muscle burn
is a good alternative to handling heavier weight because it is safer on the joints

##### Continuous Tension
Maintaining continuous tension in the muscle throughout the repetitions is a good way to increase difficulty without increasing weight. This requires that you not relax your muscles at any time during the exercise.

##### Descending Sets
Using descending sets allows you to continue a set once you have reached fatigue without having to cheat. 
How does it works? - For example, imagine that you are performing some barbell curls with 30 pounds(13.6 kg). At failure, you remove 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and resume the curls for a few extra reps. If you wish to push your muscles extra hard, whenever you reachfailure again, strip down another 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and immediately start the exercise again. In general, you should not lighten the weights more than twice during a single set.

##### Supersets
A superset involves moving from one exercise to the next without taking any rest between movements. This technique allows you to work even more beyond failure than you can using descending sets. The two main forms are antagonistic supersets and supersets for the same muscles. 
 -  Antagonistic Supersets 
> Antagonistic supersets consist of doing an exercise for one muscle followed immediately by another exercise for the antagonistic  
> muscle. For example, you start with a quadriceps exercise such as the leg extension and follow it with a hamstring exercise such as  
> the leg curl. The goal here is to save time by not having to rest between sets. The muscles of the quadriceps recover while you train  > the hamstrings, and vice versa. 
> Examples of the main antagonistic supersets:
   - Crunch for the abs and hyperextension for the lower back
   - Incline press for the chest and machine pull-down for the back
   - Lateral raise for the shoulders and rowing for the back
   - Biceps curl and pulley triceps extension
Main BENEFITS: With antagonistic supersets, by moving quickly from one exercise to another, you shape your muscles while increasing their endurance and burning more calories and fat.
 -  Supersets for the Same Muscle
> A superset for the same muscle consists of doing an exercise for a muscle followed immediately by another exercise for the same 
> muscle. The goal is to increase the time under tension and muscle burn.
> You can choose your exercises for this type of superset based on one of the following rules:
     -  Postexhaustion exercises: Start with a basic, multiple-joint exercise. When you reach exhaustion, move on to an isolating exercise. For example, the squats alone may not induce an intense muscle burn in the glutes, but by moving to the ButtBlaster, your glutes will soon be on fire.
     -   Preexhaustion exercises: Start with an isolating exercise. When you reach exhaustion, move on to a basic, multiple-joint exercise. For example, start training your buttocks with a machine such as the Butt Blaster. At failure, go directly to the squat or the lunge. 
Main BENEFITS: With antagonistic supersets, by moving quickly from one exercise to another, you shape your muscles while increasing their endurance and burning more calories and fat.
