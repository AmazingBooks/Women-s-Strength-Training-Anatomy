## PART 1 - 20 Steps to Creating a Personalized Program
> Creating your own program involves 20 steps, described below. They will give you the answers you need to start training with a program
>that best matches your goals.
>The 20 steps outlined here combine resistance training and cardio training.
>You may have decided that you want to perform only resistance training. However, if you have fat to lose or have difficulty maintaining >your body weight, it
>is wise to add some cardio training. Stretching regularly to maintain flexibility
>as well as good posture is also important, especially given that it requires only
>a few minutes per week.Rest assured that as long as you are training regularly and eating a balanced, healthy diet, fat will diminish and muscles will develop.

## STEP 1 - Identify Your Goals
To create a perfectly tailored weight training program that suits your needs, you must first clearly define your objectives:
  - Reshape your body
  - Get rid of excess body fat
  - Improve your sport performance
  - Remain healthy
  - Fight the loss of mobility due to aging

## STEP 2 - Decide How Many Days Per Week to Train
For the various schedules, here are the options:
  - One weekly weight training session: This schedule does not pose any recovery issues, and weight training can be done on any day.
  - Two weekly weight training sessions: Separate workouts as much as possible (e.g., Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday), but at a minimum, try to respect the pattern of one workout and one day of rest. 
  - Three weekly weight training sessions: With this schedule, respecting the one-workout-one-day-of-rest pattern is difficult, but still possible. Try to balance your week as much as possible—for example, by weight training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
 - Four weekly weight training sessions: With such a high training frequency, properly spacing the workouts to provide your body with enough rest is difficult. Whenever you perform two workouts without rest between them, make sure that one targets your upper body and the other targets your lower body.
## STEP 3 - Choose Your Training Days
To progress quickly, follow this one main rule: One day of weight training has to be followed by at least one day of rest from weight training (so doing a cardio workout the day after a weight training session is a possibility). Cardio training has fewer constraints because it does not traumatize the body nearly as much as weight training does. 
## STEP 4 - Decide Whether to Train More Than Once Per Day
We strongly advise not to weight train twice a day. Ideally, cardio can be performed on days you do not weight train. But it is conceivable to do cardio in the morning and weight training later in the day. Alternatively, you can weight train in the morning and do cardio at night. 
## STEP 5 - Choose Your Training Time
Is it better to train in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, or in the evening?
ANSWER: Scientific studies have shown that muscle strength and endurance vary throughout the day. Most women are stronger in the afternoon and weaker in the morning. The body is a little bit colder in the morning, and it slowly warms up with time and as a result of eating. This slight elevation in temperature is associated with an increase in central nervous system efficiency. Therefore, muscle power rises in parallel with body temperature. Training whenever your muscles are at their strongest is ideal, which for most woman this peak performance occurs in the afternoon.
## STEP 6 - Choose an Order in Which to Work the Muscles in Each Session
Training your whole body in one workout would be cumbersome. There are six major body regions which must be trainned:
1. Legs (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves)
2. Abdomen
3. Back
4. Chest
5. Arms (biceps and triceps)
6. Shoulders

The following four tips can help you design your program:
1. Take full advantage of the indirect work.
Always train your arms before your back or chest. This results in the biceps or triceps being too tired to handle the weight necessary to stimulate the chest and the back. The same goes for your legs. Training your calves first will tire them and decrease
your strength for the basic leg exercises. Furthermore, the quadriceps and hamstring exercises provide enough indirect calf stimulation to render direct lower-leg exercises superfluous in many cases.
2. Rate the importance of each muscle according to your goals.
If you want chiseled abdominal muscles, you can begin each workout with abdominal exercises as a warm-up.
3. Focus on your weak areas.
4. Use the rotation principle.
## STEP 7 - Schedule Your Body Regions for Each Workout
If you want to make quick progress in strength and body shaping, the best thing to do is to work each muscle group twice a week.
> Four Weekly Weight Training Workouts:
#### Workout 1
 - **Lower body**: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 2
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, shoulders, and back
 - **Lower body**: glutes
#### Workout 3
 - **Lower body**: glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 4
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, chest, and arms
 - **Lower body**: hamstrings
## STEP 8 - Determine How Many Exercises to do Per Body Region
## STEP 9 -Choose the Number of Sets Per Muscle Group
For aesthetic purposes, muscles can artificially be divided into the following
three major categories:
1. Most important muscles: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
2. Complex muscles: back, shoulders, and abdominals
3. Less important muscles: chest, biceps, triceps, forearms, and calves
Beginners should aim for the following totals:
 - Two or three sets for each of the most important muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One set for each of the less important muscles
After a couple months of training, you should aim for the following:
 - Three or four sets for each of the most important muscles 
 - Two or three sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the less important muscles
After six months of training, you should aim for the following totals:
 - Four or five sets for each of the most important muscles
 - Three or four sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One to three sets for each of the less important muscles
 
## STEP 10 - Choose the Number of Repetitions Per Set
How many times (repetitions) should you perform an exercise in each set? 
- For muscle toning, it is best to do from 10 to 20 repetitions with heavier weights. 
- To burn calories and fat and to improve your cardiovascular health, do at least 30 repetitions, and up to 50, with lighter weights.
##### Use the three set rule: 
   - Once your muscles are fully warmed up, start with a light weight and a high number of repetitions (e.g., 20) for the first set.        - For the second set increase the weight enough so that you can perform only 12 to 15 repetitions.
   - For the third set, add weight so that you can perform only 10 repetitions.
## STEP 11 - Decide How Long Your Workout Should Last
How much time should you devote to each workout? 
 - This issue is very important not only to get fast results but also, and more important, to be able to stick to your program. You do not want to use too long a workout as an excuse not to go to the gym. A brief workout is much better than no workout at all.
 - The objective of a good workout is to stimulate muscles to their maximum in the shortest time possible. What you should look for are strategies that increase a workout’s intensity rather than its length.
A good weight training workout lasts at least 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 45 minutes. If you spend more than one hour working out, your effort is not intense enough. At the end of 30 to 45 minutes, your muscles should be begging for mercy.
The duration of your workout depends on two things:
1. Volume of work (number of exercises plus number of sets)
2. Rest time between sets

Do not weight train for more than an hour because this means that you are doing one, or a combination, of the following:
 - Working too many muscles per session
 - Doing too many exercises
 - Doing too many sets
 - Taking too much rest time between sets
## STEP 12 - Learn the Proper Speed for Each Repetition
The speed of your repetitions is a very important factor in the success of your program. Do not lift a weight with too much speed by using momentum and body swings instead of your own muscle strength. If you are just starting weight lifting, use a deliberate tempo rather than an explosive motion. You will quickly realize that a slower motion is more excruciating than a fast one. You use your muscles much more when you lift a weight up and down slowly, which is exactly what you want.
We recommend that you take two or three seconds to raise a weight and atleast as much time, if not slightly more, to lower it. The weaker your muscles are, the slower each repetition should be performed. Raise the weight in five seconds and lower it in three to five seconds. 
## STEP 13 -Determine How Long to Rest Between Sets
Consider your rest time between sets as a tool to help you reach your goal faster. If you mainly wish to sculpt your muscles, you need to rest long enough so that you recover most of your strength. On the other hand, you do not want to rest so much that your workout loses its intensity despite the heavier weight. If your goal is mainly to burn fat, do not rest much. Following are good between-set resting guidelines:
 - To tone up, 30 to 45 seconds of rest should suffice. 
 - To burn calories and fat, you should adopt a faster pace with only 10 to 20 seconds of rest between sets. As you progress, reduce this resting time to a bare minimum. 
Research has shown that women performing a similar workload as men produce less lactic acid and experience a lower elevation of heart rate. Therefore, we require less rest than men do between sets.
## STEP 14 - Avoid Rest Time Between Two Different Exercises
Avoid wasting time when changing exercises. The time required to move from one machine to the next and adjust the seat or the weight (or both) provides enough rest. You might even have to wait for someone to finish a set. Do not add this compulsory wait time to a voluntary rest you just took. Moving fast burns both more calories and more fat while cutting down on the time you spend in the gym.
## STEP 15 - Pick the Proper Weight for Each Exercise
Start with a resistance that seems too light to be challenging for your muscles. This easy set will serve as a first warm-up.
For your real first working set, increase the resistance even more. For your second working set, you might increase the resistance slightly more to render the movement more challenging. It is very helpful to note each of your weights as well as the number of repetitions you performed for each exercise in a notebook or in your phone. There are plenty of apps for this.
## STEP 16 - Know When to Increase Resistance
If you scrupulously note all your workouts as suggested, you will easily figure outwhen to increase your weight for your next workout. If you do not write down your weight, you will face a very tedious task.
#### As a rule of thumb:
 - If you performed more repetitions than expected for an exercise in your last workout, pick up a slightly heavier weight today.
 - If you perform fewer repetitions than expected for an exercise in your last workout, use the same amount of resistance until you feel very comfortable with that weight.
## STEP 17 - Choose Exercises That Suit Your Morphology
Everybody's morphology is unique in terms of height and the length of torso, legs, and arms. Some exercises force us to adopt unnatural positions, whereas others feel very natural to us. If a movement places you in an uncomfortable position, eliminate it from your routine. When you start lifting, stick to movements that you feel your build is designed to perform safely. 
As a rule of thumb, the taller you are, the more dangerous the basic free weight exercises will be because you have to go through
a much greater range of motion. This is typically true of the squat and the chest press. By the same token, body weight exercises such as push-ups are likely to be more traumatic for your joints, also because of this greater range of motion.
#### Machines Versus Free Weights - Which is more effective?
The two main kinds of resistance in weight training are free weights (dumbbells and bar) and machines. Hamstrings, are difficult to train without machines. On the other hand, free weights are more appropriate for biceps. For this reason, a combination of both is best. It is a common belief in the gym that free weights are more effective than machines. This is simply not true. The most effective way to make progress is to use machines whenever they are more appropriate than free weights, and free weights whenever they are
more appropriate than machines. Beginner should use machines machines, because they are typically much easier to master and better guide your movement as you learn the exerciseMany new machines provide quick response (QR) codes that allow you to view a video of how to use the machine on your smartphone. You do not have to rely on anyone to demonstrate the proper use of the equipment. Of course,
there is no such QR code on free weights. Women starting weight lifting are more likely to make better progress with machines than with free weights. As you progress, you can move on to more complex, free weight exercises. They will be easier then because your muscles will have gotten used to the workout. Starting directly with free weight movement is more complicated because it involves motor learning that will slow down your gains of muscle strength.
#### There are Two Major Exercise Subcategories
All movements, can be divided into two major categories: 
 - basic and multiple-joint exercises;
 - isolated and single-joint exercises.
1. Basic, multiple-joint exercises: Whenever more than one joint is flexed, the exercise is classified as a basic, multiple-joint exercise. For example, in a leg lunge, the knees, ankles, and hips are mobilized. Basic movements are more demanding than isolated movements, and they save time in your workout by working multiple muscles, but they are more complex to master.
2. Isolated, single-joint exercises: Whenever only one joint is flexed, the exercise is classified as an isolated, single-joint exercise. For example, in the leg extension, only the knees are mobilized. Because of the lesser demand on the body, isolated movements are easier to perform than basic, multiple-joint ones. However, because they recruit fewer muscles groups, they are less effective in terms of strength gains and calorie expenditure. 
## STEP 18 - Recognize When It’s Time to Change Your Program
Maintain the same training program for as long as you are making gains on it. Once you are familiar with weight training, feel free to change your exercises as frequently as you wish because there are few learning curves as you introduce new movements.
## STEP 19 - Take a Break
If you go on a vacation or feel as though you need a break, it is fine to stop training for one or two weeks. But remember that when you stop working out, you do not burn as many calories; if you do not watch your diet, you might accumulate fat easily.
## STEP 20 - Maintain Your Gains
Maintaining muscle gain is easier than acquiring it. If strength increases rapidly as you first start training, its reduction occurs quickly if you stop working out for a while. Muscle shape is more resistant to a long rest period, which demonstrates that the reduction of strength is mainly due to a temporary weakening of the nervous signals. Your peak strength will return to its maximum within a couple weeks of training.

#### How do you increase the intesity of your trainning? 
- The most obvious are adding weight and increasing the number of repetitions. These techniques use the overload principle. Both are excellent ways to put more stress on the muscles, but they also place more tension on the joints and ligaments;

## Techniques to increase training intensity without traumatizing your joints:
##### Muscle Burn
As your set progresses, your muscles feel as if they are burning. As you perform more and more repetitions, the intensity of this burn amplifies. This painful sensation is caused by the accumulation of waste known as lactic acid that gets trapped in the working muscles. The muscle burn pain is a signal that you are pushing your muscles past what they are accustomed to. As a result, they have to become stronger and more resistant, which also translates into increased muscle definition. Because it makes you uncomfortable, lactic acid may seem like an enemy. One goal of weight training is to turn this obstacle around and transform it into an opportunity for progression. Your main concern should be to learn how to generate and tolerate as much muscle burn as possible. Trying to achieve more muscle burn
is a good alternative to handling heavier weight because it is safer on the joints

##### Continuous Tension
Maintaining continuous tension in the muscle throughout the repetitions is a good way to increase difficulty without increasing weight. This requires that you not relax your muscles at any time during the exercise.

##### Descending Sets
Using descending sets allows you to continue a set once you have reached fatigue without having to cheat. 
How does it works? - For example, imagine that you are performing some barbell curls with 30 pounds(13.6 kg). At failure, you remove 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and resume the curls for a few extra reps. If you wish to push your muscles extra hard, whenever you reachfailure again, strip down another 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and immediately start the exercise again. In general, you should not lighten the weights more than twice during a single set.

##### Supersets
A superset involves moving from one exercise to the next without taking any rest between movements. This technique allows you to work even more beyond failure than you can using descending sets. The two main forms are antagonistic supersets and supersets for the same muscles. 
 -  Antagonistic Supersets 
> Antagonistic supersets consist of doing an exercise for one muscle followed immediately by another exercise for the antagonistic  
> muscle. For example, you start with a quadriceps exercise such as the leg extension and follow it with a hamstring exercise such as  
> the leg curl. The goal here is to save time by not having to rest between sets. The muscles of the quadriceps recover while you train  > the hamstrings, and vice versa. 
> Examples of the main antagonistic supersets:
   - Crunch for the abs and hyperextension for the lower back
   - Incline press for the chest and machine pull-down for the back
   - Lateral raise for the shoulders and rowing for the back
   - Biceps curl and pulley triceps extension
Main BENEFITS: With antagonistic supersets, by moving quickly from one exercise to another, you shape your muscles while increasing their endurance and burning more calories and fat.
 -  Supersets for the Same Muscle
> A superset for the same muscle consists of doing an exercise for a muscle followed immediately by another exercise for the same 
> muscle. The goal is to increase the time under tension and muscle burn.
> You can choose your exercises for this type of superset based on one of the following rules:
     -  Postexhaustion exercises: Start with a basic, multiple-joint exercise. When you reach exhaustion, move on to an isolating exercise. For example, the squats alone may not induce an intense muscle burn in the glutes, but by moving to the ButtBlaster, your glutes will soon be on fire.
     -   Preexhaustion exercises: Start with an isolating exercise. When you reach exhaustion, move on to a basic, multiple-joint exercise. For example, start training your buttocks with a machine such as the Butt Blaster. At failure, go directly to the squat or the lunge. 
Main BENEFITS: With antagonistic supersets, by moving quickly from one exercise to another, you shape your muscles while increasing their endurance and burning more calories and fat.

## Tips and Tricks SECTION
###### Importance of the Warm-Up 
You can sustain an injury even while performing a very safe exercise if you do not warm up sufficiently. This is especially true as you get stronger. As you begin to be able to handle heavier weights, the warm-up becomes more and more critical. When you are not very strong, the joints and the tendons do not need much warming up because the muscular tension required is not significant. As you gain strength, you will need to increase your warm-up time, because you will be subjecting yourmuscles to tension that more and more closely approaches their point of rupture.

###### Training-Induced Headache
A training-induced headache is not, strictly speaking, an injury, but it is nonetheless a health discomfort related to physical exercise. The training-induced headache was first described by Hippocrates in 450 BC. Fortunately, it affects only a minority of women. As they start training, a mild to serious headache develops. This pain can last from a few minutes to a day and prevent them from training altogether. If you suffer from this condition, you should warm up very slowly and thoroughly to prevent it or at least postpone it. Avoid increasing the intensity immediately. Perform a few minutes of easy cardio to get your blood moving. Despite what is usually recommended, start your workout with a smaller body part and a light isolating exercise such as the shoulder lateral raise. Use compound movements such as squats or deadlifts at the very end of your workout because they are the most likely to trigger a headache if you are prone to it.

###### Stretching
Women’s tendons are already much more flexible than men’s are. This is one reason their joints are looser and more prone to injuries. If your joints are already unstable, stay away from stretching the muscles surrounding them. This is very common at the shoulder level. Strength training can tighten the shoulder joints so that they become more stable and less prone to injuries. However, don’t avoid
all stretching exercises just because you have an unstable shoulder. You can still stretch your hips, your lower back, your ankles, and other areas. Following a workout is the best time to stretch because a temporary reduction in muscle strength, if it occurs, will not be an issue. Ideally, you should stretch the muscles you have just worked because theywill be warm.

###### How to Stretch? 
  - Static stretching: Static stretching consists of holding the stretch position for 10 to 30 seconds. The degree of stretch has to be modulated according to your level of flexibility. If you are not flexible, do not stretch too much or for too long. As your flexibility improves, you can intensify the degree of stretching. 
  - Dynamic stretching: Dynamic stretching uses movement, often sportspecific movement, to achieve a stretch. Walking lunges, arm circles, and leg swings are examples of this type of stretch. 
  - Ballistic stretching: Ballistic stretching combines small bursts of stretching with small recoils of muscle contractions. You can repeat this combination of small, back and forth movements for 10 to 30 seconds.

##### Joint Laxity During Menstruation 
The risk of injury, especially of ligaments, is much greater in women than in men. For example, the incidence of tearing the cruciate ligaments of the knee is three times higher in female athletes than in their male counterparts. This vulnerability is largely due to a higher secretion of estrogen in women than in men. It is especially true during the preovulatory period. By the same token, hormonal fluctuations during this period cause increased flexibility in the muscles and tendons, suddenly rendering the joints less stable. Whenever you notice a sudden increase in joint laxity, stop stretching that joint. Also, reduce the amount of weight you are using on the exercises that mobilize that joint because the risk of injury has skyrocketed. Wait for stability to return to normal before resuming heavy training and stretching.

## Breakdown of Cardio Versus Weight Training
Weight training and cardio (aerobic) training are two very different forms of exercise. Yet, they are very complementary. Medical researchers have shown that cardio training favors fat loss, whereas resistance training enhances lean muscle mass as well as strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is most appropriate for improving endurance and cardiovascular health.
The respective importance you should give to each form of training depends on your goals. Consider the following:
>  - If your priority is to lose body fat, you should mainly perform cardio training. However, do not neglect resistance training to preserve your lean mass. It is best to spend two thirds of your time performing cardio exercises and only one third performing weight training.
>  - If you mainly want to tone your body, devote two thirds of your time to weights and one third to cardio.
>  - If you desire to tone up and lose fat at the same time, divide your training time equally between weights and cardio.
>  - If you are too skinny, you can skip cardio as you attempt to gain as much muscle as possible.

#### Timing of Cardio Training
Following are times to perform cardio training:
  - First thing in the morning
  - At night, before bedtime
  - After and Before weight training
You can also perform half your cardio before weight training as a warm-up and the other half at the end of the workout as a cool-down. Researchers have shown that cardio training involving the legs before a lower-body workout temporarily reduces leg strength. This does not occur when cardio is performed before an upper-body training session. The timing of your cardio training will be mainly dictated by your daily schedule, but it can also depend on the effects you wish to produce in your body. Fatty acid release from the adipose tissues is not constant throughout the day. It follows a natural circadian pattern of being higher in the evening and in the morning after fasting overnight and lower during the day. It makes sense to perform cardio whenever the release of lipids is elevated, because doing so facilitates utilization and fat destruction. This means that cardio would be most beneficial when performed either in the evening or first thing in the morning. 

#### Timing of Eating With Cardio Training
Cardio can be performed in the morning on an empty stomach to use more fat as fuel because your body is running low on glycogen (energy) after a night of fasting. Studies have shown that performing cardio in a fasted state is the best way to reduce abnormally high triglycerides and cholesterol levels. On the other hand, cardio in a fasted state is not very effective for addressing glycemia. Our conclusion is that if you are prone to diabetes, it is best to do cardio after your last meal of the day. Our conclusion is that if you are prone to diabetes, it is best to do cardio after your last meal of the day. 

#### High-Intensity Versus Low-Intensity Cardio
Following are the two main forms of cardio training:
  - High-intensity cardio: The goal of high-intensity cardio is to run, cycle, or swim as fast as possible for around 20 minutes. The main advantage is that this burns a lot of calories in a minimal amount of time. Its main drawback is that while some of the
energy comes from fat, most of it is derived from reserves of carbohydrate (glycogen inside the muscle). This is an inefficient way of losing fat; the best way is to burn fat rather than carbohydrate.
  - Low-intensity cardio: The goal of low-intensity cardio is to run, cycle, or swim at a slower pace for at least 30 minutes. The main advantage is that it burns a lot of fat while sparing glycogen. Its main drawback is that it is more time-consuming because it burns fewer calories per minute.

#### Cardio Training Methods
In summary, running may be more beneficial than cycling to lose weight. However, running is much more traumatic for the knees, hips, and lower back. The treadmill is obviously less traumatic than classic running. Biomechanical studies have shown that to reduce the pressure on the knees and the hips, it is best to use slower, long strides rather than short, fast ones. A stair stepper is a great alternative to running, especially because it targets the glutes more than the treadmill does.

#### Keeping a Workout Notebook
It is important to keep a workout notebook so you can easily recall the number of repetitions you did for each exercise as well as the weight, or resistance, you used. Note the duration of your workouts as well. Time measurement is important because, if you rest longer between sets, your performance will improve, but it will not necessarily result in strength gains. To compare two workouts, you must
ensure that they are of approximately the same duration.
After each workout, examine your training session and ask yourself the following questions:
  - What worked well?
  - What did not work well? 
  - Why did it not work well?
  - How can I improve my next workout?

How can you determine whether you really used the proper form in each exercise? An easy way is to film yourself. If possible, do so from a different angle at each successive set. It can be very surprising to see yourself train because the fluidity of the movement is not always what you imagine. Using this feedback, you can immediately self-correct and thereby improve your form. High-level athletes
frequently use this strategy to enhance their techniques.

#  PART II - Exercises
### Now some of the must known Topics: 
 #### 1. How do you round your Glutes?
There are plenty of body weight exercises for toning the glutes. they work wonders at first, but their main limitation is the lack of resistance they provide. After a while, as your muscles get stronger, these exercises become too easy. You may perform more and more repetitions, but this is not the best way to get fast results. You have to overload the glutes with constantly heavier weights
to get them to respond. Because at first any repetition pattern provides results, it is best to remainbelow the 25-repetition range for toning. If you want rapid toning the best way to go is simply use the machines, beacuse they allow you to easily add resistance to really overload the glutes, which is the key to rapid results in muscle toning.
Now to understand how the Glutes work let's find out about the Anatomy and Morphology of the GLUTES. 
The glutes comprise three muscles:
  - **Gluteus Maximus**, which is by far the biggest of the three glute muscles. It is also the most visible.
  - **Gluteus Medius**, which is a small muscle that lies laterally above the gluteus maximus. It is visible from the side and the rear.
  - **Gluteus Minimus**, which is a small muscle that lies laterally below the gluteus maximus. therefore, it is not visible at all.
this section concentrates mainly on the gluteus maximus and a little on the gluteus medius.
![Glute Muscles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/muscles.png)

**How to effciently trigger your Glutes?** - When you walk slowly, they hardly work. But as soon as you accelerate and start running, the glutes are heavily recruited. So is time to put those trainning shoes on and start running 😏.

**How to improve your Glutes contour?** - Regular weight training will increase the size as well as the roundness and firmness of the glutes. It may also somewhat lift up the glutes, but this is far harder to achieve.
To visualize what you are trying to achieve, consider a woman’s overall posture and appearance while wearing high heels; specif cally, the lower back is slightly arched and the glutes are more visible. By weight training your glutes properly, you can achieve the same effect without the high heels.

  #### 2. Debunking Cellulite step by step
 
###### What is Cellulite and How it develops?
 - Development begins in adolescence, when girls start to release more and more female hormones. Both estrogen
and progesterone favor the growth of fat cells, particularly in the lower body. This fat proliferation impairs the microcirculation of blood in the lower body, which triggers localized inflammation. As a result of this blood flow restriction and inflammation, extra water is retained in the legs and bundles of collagen that give the skin its firmness become damaged. This looser skin explains theorange peel appearance of cellulite. Your genetic background also plays a major role in the localization of fat deposits around your glute area.

###### How can we get rid of Cellulite?
Is it possible to spot-reduce cellulite by specifically working the legs or the glutes? 
For a long time, medical studies were not able to prove that fat could be specifically eliminated in trouble spots by stimulating the underlying muscles. Increasing the adipose tissue blood ﬂ ow enhances the local release of fat, whereas reduced blood ﬂ ow inside a fat deposit promotes its growth. therefore, working a muscle group frequently not only prevents local fat hypertrophy but also favors the topical release of fat. consequently, it is important to frequently contract the muscles located under the fat deposit you want to
get rid of. 
***However, note that the magnitude of the local fat release is small. Therefore, you will not see results in weeks, but rather, in months, unless you follow a low-calorie diet. If you wish to develop __Leaner Legs__, you can do either cycling or running. We do not recommend swimming or rowing except for overall fat loss.***

**Glute exercises**
There are 4 main categories of Glutes exercises from which women can benefit:
  1. Hip Extension
  2. Bridge
  3. One-leg Butt Press
  4. Lateral Hip Abduction
  
**Note**: squats, lunges, and deadlifts are also excellent exercises for the glutes.

**Tips for efficient Glutes execises**: 
 - **Squeeze those Buttocks** - To better recruit the glutes while performing these exercises, squeeze your buttocks together tightly throughout the exercises.
 - **Warm Up the Glutes** - Always start with Warm up the Glutes by performing 20-30 easy repetitions of the following exercises using light weigths. Move from one exercise to the next without rest. If you do notfeel that one cycle was enough to warm you up, feel free to perform a second cycle.
 The exercises for warm up are one round of the above:
    - **Squats** -  perform 20 to 30 easy repetitions;
    - **Stiff-leg deadlift** - perform 20 to 30 easy repetitions;
    - **Calf raise** -  perform 20 to 30 easy repetitions;


## 1. Hip Extension
The hip extension belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the hip joints are mobilized. Nevertheless, the hip extension recruits muscles in addition to the gluteus maximus: the hamstrings and the lower back. 

**How to Do It**
Starting with both feet together, lift one leg up as far back as possible using your Glutes. Hold the contracted position for one second while squeezing your buttocks together as tightly as possible. Return to the starting position and repeat. Once you have finished a set with one leg, move immediately to the other leg. To increase the range of motion, you can bring your leg forward until your thigh is about parallel with the ground and then straighten it to the back. The easiest way to perform the hip extension is standing because the range of motion is short and gravity results in little resistance being placed on the Gluteus Maximus.

![Hips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/hips.png)
 
**Pros**
 - It is the easiest exercise to perform that directly targets the glute muscles.
 - It can be performed at home without much equipment.

**Cons**
 - Once you have gained more experience in weight training, you may want to move on to more complete leg exercises such as the squat or deadlift.

 **Tips**:
 - To really work the gluteus maximus, do not pivot your leg toward the outside too much. It is OK for the leg to move slightly toward the outside, but do not exaggerate this abduction of the leg.
 - Hip extension is limited by the iliofemoral ligament.
 - Free WeIghTS or MaChine? - machines render the movement more effective in terms of muscle toning by adding extra resistance, thereby increasing the difficulty of the movement.
 
###### There are 4 tipes of Variations for Glutes: 
   1. **Standing Variations** - some glute machines place extra resistance, either behind the knee or on the achilles tendon.
   2. **Prone Variations** - By lying on the floor, you increase the resistance but decrease the range of motion.
            - lie on your abdomen and support yourself on your forearms with a slight arch in your lower back.
            - You can also perform a superman version in which you start prone with your legs out behind you and your arms straight ahead and raise your legs and arms simultaneously. This variation also works the lower back and the backs of the shoulders
    3. **Kneeling Variations**(often called a donkey kick variation)- By kneeling, you increase both the resistance and the range of motion. Use an elastic band, an ankle cuff weight, or an ankle cable attachment to place extra weight on the glutes. For an added challenge, positioned on your hands and knees, simultaneously lift the opposing arm and leg. Instead of kneeling on the floor, you can place the rested knee on a bench to further increase the range of motion of the movement and therefore its difficulty.
    4. **Machine Variations** - machines called Butt Blasters add extra resistance on the soles of yourfeet to render the exercise more intense and more effective. Note that there is a difference in the movement because the knee joint is mobilized.As a result, in addition to recruiting the glutes and the hamstrings, the quadriceps also come into play.
    
## 2. Bridge
The bridge belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because the hip, knee, and ankle joints are mobilized. as a result, the bridge recruits muscles in addition to the glutes: the lumbar muscles and thighs.

###### How to Do It
Lie on your back with your knees bent at 90 degrees. place your arms by your sides. Using your shoulders as a pivot point, raise your torso by contracting your glutes as tightly as possible while pushing on your heels. hold the contracted position for one second before returning to the starting position. make sure you use constant tension by stopping each repetition short of touching the floor with your glutes.

**Pros**
 - It is a very easy exercise to perform to tone your whole legs, especially the glute muscles.
 - It can be performed at home without much equipment.

**Cons**
 - You will progress very quickly, which will force you to find ways to render this exercise more challenging.

 **Tips**:
 - Place your hands on the sides of your glutes to better feel them working.
 - To increase your range of motion, don’t arch your lower back too much.
 - Keep your lower back really straight. If you overextend it, you may damage your discs.
 - Look at the ceiling so that you do not damage your cervical spine.
 - No machine can duplicate this body weight exercise. 
 
  **Variations**:
When this exercise becomes too easy, you may render it more effective by doing any of the following:
 - Add an extra load on your body by placing a weight on the lower part of your abdomen.
 - Place your calves or feet on a bench or chair to achieve a greater range of motion requiring a more powerful muscle contraction.
 - Lift one leg.
 ![bridge-leg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/bridge-leg.png)
 ![bridge-bench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/bridge-bench.png)
 
## 3. One-Leg Butt Press
The butt press recruits muscles in addition to the glutes: the lumbar muscles and thighs.

**Pros**
 - This exercise stretches your glutes like no others can. You will feel them contract immediately

**Cons**
 - You have to work one leg at a time, which makes this exercise more time-consuming than bilateral exercises.
 - Because it is unilateral, this exercise places an uneven pressure on your lower back, which might exacerbate any existing pain or damage.

 **Tips**:
 - Do not arch your back too much as you straighten your leg in an attempt to get a more powerful contraction of the glutes. If your back is pain free, a little arching of the lower back is fine, but excessive arching can damage your discs.
 - If you don’t have access to an assisted pull-up machine, you can perform a one-leg step up.
 ![leg-press](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-press.png)

 
 ## 4. Lateral Hip Abduction
In case you want to have rounder Glutes this is the exercise for you.The lateral hip abduction does not recruit muscles other than its primary targets: the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus.

**How to Do It**
Lie on your side with your bottom hand either flat on the floor or supporting your head and your top hand resting on the floor. By contracting your glutes, raise your leg as high as possible. Hold this contraction for a count of 2 before lowering your leg. Make sure you use constant tension by stopping each repetition short of your legs touching each other. Keep your body, especially your legs, straight at all times throughout the exercise. By lying laterally on the floor, you increase the resistance but decrease the
range of motion. The working leg can be either kept straight (harder version) or bent (easier version).

**Pros**
 - Studies have shown that the lateral hip abduction is the best exercise to target the gluteus medius, the toning of which provides a rounder appearance to your glutes.

**Cons**
 - This exercise works only a tiny portion of the glutes. as a result, it should make up only a small fraction of your glute workout.
 - When performed in a unilateral fashion, this exercise might place an uneven pressure on your lower back, which could exacerbate
any existing pain.
 - Arching your back allows a greater range of motion, but this is dangerous for your lower back.

 **Tips**:
 - If your knees shake laterally during squats or lunges, your abductor muscles are too weak. abductor exercises will correct this problem and therefore better protect your knees.
 - Using your free hand to touch the part of your glutes you want to develop enhances your brain–muscle connection. This simple maneuver
enables you to feel your working muscles more, rendering the exercise more effective.
 - You can elevate your leg laterally only so far. Some women have a greater range of motion than others. this is not due to greater flexibility,but rather to the shape of their bones. 
 
**Standing Variations**
The easiest way to perform the lateral hip abduction is standing because the range of motion is short and gravity results in little resistance placed on the gluteus medius. 
![standing-hip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/standing-hip.png)

**Kneeling Variation**
By kneeling, you increase both the resistance and the range of motion. In the kneeling version, you have to bend your leg to move it up laterally.
![kneeling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/kneeling.png)

**Machine Variations**
Two kinds of machines are available to increase the resistance on your legs and make the exercise more effective.
  1. Seated, allows you to work both legs simultaneously. By bending forward or backward on the seated machine, you can shift the area of the glutes that experiences the majority of the contraction. By bending backward, you favor the recruitment of the upper area of the external part of the glutes. By bending forward, you favor the recruitment of the middle area of the external part of the glutes.
![seated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/seated.png)

  2. Standing position - Some standing machines allow you to train both legs at a time; whereas others, only one. In both versions, the movement is the same as that of the other variations.
 
**Free Weights or Machine?**
All of the lateral hip abduction variations are relatively similar. Their main differences relate only to the degree of resistance placed on the glute muscles and to the range of motion of the movement. ankle cuffs, elastic bands, and machines render the movement more effective in terms of muscle toning by adding extra resistance, thereby increasing the difficulty of the movement. 


# Tone Your Quadriceps

**Anatomy and Morphology**:

As its name implies, the quadriceps contain four muscles:
  1. The vastus lateralis, on the outside of the thigh;
  2. The rectus femoris, in the center;  
  3. The vastus medialis, on the inside of the thigh;
  4. The vastus intermedius, which is mostly covered by the other three muscles;
  
![Quadriceps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/quadriceps.png)

The main issue for women is defining how big (or small) they want their quadriceps to be. The answer is far from universal, and culture can influence preferences. In Brazil, for example, many women desire huge glutes and quadriceps. In Europe, the goal is more often to maintain thin legs. Women in the United States are more in the middle; many desire some toning to create athletic legs. Of course, these are generalizations and are not true of all women in these societies. The size of the quadriceps is a matter of taste for each woman. Most do not want to be able to see each muscle that makes up the quadriceps, because such defnition is considered a very manly feature. Therefore, you likely do want to keep some fat on your legs to hide the muscular defnition of the quadriceps.  If training the quadriceps is secondary to glute training for you, you will be happy to know that most of the basic quadriceps exercises also recruit the glutes and hamstrings.

**Quadriceps Exercises** - There are four main categories of exercises for the quadriceps from which women can benefit:
  1. Squats
  2. Leg press
  3. Lunge
  4. Leg extension
 
## 1. Squats

**How to Do It**
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, and place a barbell on your upper back. Keeping your back arched very slightly backward, bend your legs just until your torso starts to really bend forward. When this happens, thigh involvement lessens and the lumbar muscles begin to do the majority of the work. When you have reached your low position, push down through your heels
to straighten your legs. Once you are upright, perform another repetition.

**Pros**
 - The whole lower-body and part of the upper-body muscles are recruited, which makes the squat one of the most complete exercises.

**Cons**
 - The squat is a very difficult exercise to perform and requires athletic skills a beginner may not have.
 - Because this exercise is exhausting, it carries some risk for the knees and back. Hanging at a pull-up bar to stretch your spine after your workout is advised, as it is with every workout.

 **Tips**:
 - Whenever you use a barbell, do not place it on your neck because doing so is likely to hurt your spine. Place the bar below your neck, roughly at your rear shoulder level. If the bar hurts, put a towel around it to make it more comfortable.
![squats-bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/squats-bar.png)

 - In order to increase the muscular intensity of the squat, use a continuous tension technique. This means that instead of allowing your leg muscles to rest at the top of the movement by completely straightening your legs, you stop your squat short and don’t straighten your legs completely. perform as many repetitions as possible using continuous tension. When the burn becomes unbearable, straighten your legs at the top of the movement in order to give your muscles a short rest, which will allow you to perform a few extra reps.
 
 - Placing a thin board of wood or a weight plate under your heels will make it easier to keep your back straight as you go down. This trick is particularly helpful if you have long femurs or inflexible ankles.
 
 ![squats-board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/squats-board.png)
 
 - In order to protect your spine from excessive damaging pressure, as your muscles grow stronger, we recommend that you don’t perform
both squats and deadlifts during the same workout. As you advance in your training, center your leg workouts around squats and save the deadlifts for your back workouts.
   - Don't look down or to the side when performing a squat. rather, look in front of you and slightly up to avoid damaging your neck.
   - Rounding your back, especially at the end of a set when your muscles are tired, is much easier than keeping your back straight, but this rounded position increases the risk of damaging your lumbar discs.
   
   ![round-back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/round-back.png)

### Squats and the importance of Stance Width
Varying the width of your feet during the squat can change the muscles targeted. Keeping them at about shoulder width and slightly turned out results in the __muscles of the entire thigh doing equal work__. When you narrow your stance, __the focus is on the quadriceps__, and __the knee joints__ experience greater pressure. Adopting a very **wide stance** works the __inner thighs, hamstrings,
and glutes__. As with all variations, choose the one that feels most natural to you at first. Later, you can adopt a position that targets particular muscular zones.
 ![Stance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/stance.png)
 ![Powersquat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/powesquat.png)
 
### Body Weight Variations Squats
The easiest squat version is the free squat, in which you use only your own body weight. You can practice this exercise at home to tone up your legs without having to go to the gym. The main problem is that body weight squats rapidly become too easy because of the lack of resistance. Choose the arm position(with arms crossed in front or down at the sides) that feels the mostcomfortable and secure for you; arm position does not alter the recruitment of the leg muscles. Alternatively, you can do one-leg squats, which are much harder than
regular squats and do not put pressure on the spine. If this variation is new to you, make sure you control the degree of descent, because the maximal range of motion of the one-leg squat can be much greater than that of the regular squat. going as deep as possible may result in profound muscular soreness after your workout. Therefore, increase your range of motion gradually over several workouts.

![free-squat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/free-squat.png)

### Squat Depth
The deeper you lower the weight, the more intense the squat becomes, because as you increase your range of motion, you are not recruiting only your quadriceps. Your hamstrings and especially your buttocks are going to be heavily recruited, as well. So, it seems to be a good idea to squat deep. From a muscular stand point, this is correct. But this is also where your morphology will come into play. The taller you are, the more you will have to bend your torso forward in order to keep your equilibrium as you squat down. In this position, the risk of spinal injury increases dramatically. Many people claim that bending the torso forward during a squat is bad
technique. But morphologically, if you have long quadriceps and a shorter torso, it is mechanically impossible to keep your back straight as you go down in squats. You must bend forward to keep your balance. This is why it is easier to keep your back straight using a Smith machine because there is no balance issue! If you find that you have to bend forward to a dangerous level in free squats, you would be wise to find an alternative to this exercise rather than waste hours trying to master a technique that you cannot perform morphologically.

![deep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/deep.png)


### Dumbbell Variations
 - When you grab one dumbbell between your legs, your thighs have towork harder, rendering the squat more effective. as an alternative, you can use a strong elastic band or squat on one leg only.
- Grabbing two dumbbells adds even more resistance. The main advantage of dumbbells over a barbell is that they make it easier to keep your back straight and to keep your balance. however, as you grow stronger, dumbbells will not offer the resistance required to progress even more. This is when graduating to a long bar is required. By then, you should be able to keep your balance despite the overload placed on your legs. 

![dumbell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/dumbell.png)

![dumbell-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/dumbell-1.png)

### Resistance Band Variation
An elastic band can replace dumbbells. The main advantage of the resistance band is that it provides a variable resistance that suits your muscular strength exactly. At the bottom of the movement, where your muscles are weaker, the band offers less resistance. as you straighten your legs and your muscles get stronger, the band gets pulled and therefore offers more resistance.

![resistance-band](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/resistance-band.png)


### Front squat Variation
 - The front squat allows you to keep your back straighter than you can with the classic back squat. Doing the front squat variation it shifts the muscular recruitment from the glutes to the quadriceps, which may not be your goal if your main focus is glute development. Furthermore, carrying the bar on the front shoulders will feel very uncomfortable for many women. Moreover, mastering proper front squat technique is difficult. Without it, you will be very prone to losing your balance. as a result of these problems, the front squat is not a top leg exercise for most women.

![front-squat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/front-squat.png)

### Smith Machine Variation
Smith machines can be a good substitute for free-weight squats because the guidance they offer reduces the likelihood of accident due to a loss of balance. On a Smith machine you can place your feet forward, which allows you to keep your back very straight. In that position, you are recruiting your glutes while sparing your spine and your knees. Because of the stability of the Smith machine, you can easily keep your balance. Therefore, it is an excellent substitute for free squats, especially for beginners.

![Smith Machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/smith.png)

The Smith machine also allows you to adopt just about every foot position you wish to better target the areas of your lower body you
want. Following are foot positions and the muscles they tend to recruit:

![Smith Machine Variations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/smith-1.png)

> FREE WEIGHTS or MACHINE?
> There are plenty of squat machines. Their main advantage is that they are less hazardous than the free squat because you have no
> degree of freedom in terms of the trajectory of the movement. Therefore, it is much harder to lose your balance. This is especially   > important for beginners with no athletic background.


## 2. Leg Press
The leg press belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because the hip, knee, and ankle joints are mobilized. As a result, the leg press recruits muscles in addition to the quadriceps: the glutes, hamstrings, and calves. The leg press is considered safer than the squat because it places less pressure on the lower back (which does not mean no pressure). Furthermore, the seat of the leg press machine offers good back support, which limits the risks of an accidental back twist. Also, because the trajectory of the movement is completely guided by the machine, fewer balance problems occur. There are plenty of versions of the leg press. You can sit or lie in the seat. 

**How to Do It**
Sit in the machine with your feet about shoulder-width apart on the foot platform. Keeping your back as straight as possible, bend your legs. Do not go all the way down! Stop whenever you feel your buttocks start to lift off the seat. At that moment, push with your thighs to straighten your legs. Once they are almost straight, perform another repetition.

**Pro**
  - Because the movement is guided and the lower back is well supported, the leg press is one of the safest lower-body exercises.
  
**Cons**
  - Some leg presses are poorly designed, and even a very good leg press machine may not suit your morphology.
  - The leg press may seem to be totally safe for the lower back. It is not! Although it is much safer than the squat, your spine will receive a great deal of pressure especially if you use an ample range of motion.

![Leg Press](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-press.png)
  
 **Tips**
  - The wider your stance or greater your step is, the more your glutes and hamstrings have to work. Leaning your torso forward a little has the same effect.
  - Lifting your low back off the seat increases the range of motion of the exercise and enhances the recruitment of your glutes. however, although this may seem like a great idea, it will endanger your lower back. So, we do not recommend it.


**Variations**
  1. **Varying level of descent** -  The lower you go, the more difficult the press becomes because it recruits a growing number of muscle groups. However, the level of descent must take into account not only the muscles you want to focus on but also your morphology. The longer your legs are, particularly your thighs, the more dangerous it is for your lower back and your knees if you go very low. An unfavorable leg-to-torso ratio will result in your having to lift your buttocks off the seat to keep lowering the foot platform, which increases the tension on your spine.
  2. **Varying foot placement** - You can adopt just about any foot position you wish to better target the muscle group you want. Following are foot placements and the muscles they recruit:
  
  a. High on the platform: glutes and hamstrings (spares the knees)
  b. Low on the platform: quadriceps (this position is tougher on the knees)
  c. Together: quadriceps
  d. Wide apart: adductors

![Leg Press Position](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/legpress-pos.png)

## Lunge
The lunge belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because the hip, knee, and ankle joints are mobilized. as a result, the lunge recruits muscles in addition to the quadriceps: the glutes, hamstrings, and calves.

**How to Do It**
From a starting position with your feet together and both legs straight, take a step forward with your right leg. At first, go down about 8 to 10 inches (about 20 cm). As you get stronger, you will be able to use a greater range of motion to make the exercise more difficult. Once you reach the bottom position, push back up with the right leg. Don’t straighten the right leg completely; keeping a slight bend maintains constant tension in the muscles. after completing a set with the right leg, move on to the left leg with minimal rest. 
![Lunges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/lunges.png)

**Pros**
  - Lunges are both a muscle builder and an excellent stretching movement.
  - If you had to select only one leg exercise, it should be lunges; they recruit the quadriceps, hamstrings, and buttocks.
  - Very little equipment is required to perform lunges.
  - Body weight lunges will provide very little lower back stress. Even weighted lunges are far safer for the spine than squats.
  
**Cons**
  - Working one leg at a time can be time-consuming.
  - The farther or more heavily you step, the more stress your kneecap will receive.
 
**Tips**
  - Rest your free hand (if you have one) on the muscle you want to isolate (glutes or quadriceps) to better feel the muscle contracting.
  - The wider your stance or greater your step is, the more your glutes and hamstrings have to work. Leaning your torso forward a little has the same effect.
  
![Lunges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/lunges-1.png)

## 3. Leg Extension
The leg extension belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the knee joint is mobilized. as a consequence, the leg extension does not recruit many of the muscle groups surrounding the quadriceps. Leg extensions are often used to warm up the knees at the beginning of a leg workout.

**How to Do It**
Sit in a leg extension machine and position your feet under the padded frame. Using your quadriceps, straighten your legs. Keep the contracted position for at least one second before bending your legs and repeating the movement.
![Leg Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-extension.png)

**Pro**
  - Unlike most quadriceps exercises, there is no compression of the spine
  
**Cons**
  - The leg extension is used to increase the definition of each head of the quadriceps. The glutes are not recruited at all; therefore, if glute development is your main goal, this is not the best exercise for you.

**Tips**
  - Put your hands on your quadriceps to better feel the contraction.
  - Don’t arch your lower back in an attempt to create a stronger quadriceps contraction.
  
**Variation**
If you don’t have access to a leg extension machine, you can perform the exercise while sitting, one leg at a time. You can also use a pair of ankle weights for added resistance.

![Leg Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-extension-1.png)

## Shape Your Hamstrings

The hamstrings (the backs of the thighs) contain a group of four heads:
  #### 1. Biceps femoris, short head
  #### 2. Biceps femoris, long head
  #### 3. Semimembranosus
  #### 4. Semitendinosus
 
**Take-Home Lesson for Women

The hamstrings’ placement just below the glutes helps enhance the feminine curvature of the buttocks. Having round buttocks and flat hamstrings would look odd. The hamstrings should be round as well, to accentuate the roundness of the glutes. The adductors are not muscles you want to make bigger. They just need to be very slightly toned. More important, they should be trained with light weights and high repetitions (no more than 25) to prevent the accumulation of unaesthetic fat deposits on them. Another good reason for using lighter weights is that the adductors are very fragile muscles that are easily overstretched and torn. So, little weights with higher repetitions are perfect for them.

#### Hamstring Exercises
There are three main categories of exercises for the hamstrings, plus one for the adductors, from which women can benefit:

`1. Stiff-leg deadlift`

`2. Lying leg curl`

`3. Seated leg curl`

`4. Thigh adduction`



## 1. Stiff-leg Deadlift
The stiff-leg deadlift belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because it mostly mobilizes the hip joint only, even though other joints are placed under extreme tension during the exercise. As a result, the stiff-leg deadlift recruits muscles in addition to the hamstrings: the glutes, lower back, and quadriceps. It differs from the other hamstring exercises in that it provides a strong muscle stretch.

**How to do it**
With your feet about shoulder-width apart and your back arched very slightly backward, bend over and lift two dumbbells or a barbell from the floor. Use a natural hand grip with dumbbells—that is, a semi-pronated grip that is somewhere between neutral (thumbs forward) and pronated (thumbs facing each other). Use a pronated grip with a bar. Stand up using the strength of your hamstrings and your glutes while keeping your legs semistraight. Once you are standing, bend forward without bending your legs to return to your starting position. The weights do not have to touch the floor before you start another repetition.

![Stiff Leg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/stiff-leg.png)

![Stiff Leg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/stiff-leg1.png)


**Pro**
  - This is the best exercise for working the hamstrings intensely.
  
**Cons**
  - Because it stretches the hamstrings very intensely, this exercise can cause intense soreness that may last a few days.
  - Although the stiff-leg deadlift may seem easy, it is actually much more dangerous than it appears. Maintaining both your balance and good technical execution can be difficult. Bending your spine and pulling too much with your back rather than your hamstrings can allow you to use more weight or do more repetitions, but this will reduce the workload on your hamstrings and make this exercise dangerous for your spine.

**Tips**
  - If you have good flexibility, consider leaning forward with your torso parallel to the ground; then stand up. If this places too much tension on either your spine or your hamstrings, stop the movement short of parallel.
  - Do not bring your torso up until it is perpendicular to the floor. By not coming all the way up, you maintain continuous tension in the hamstrings. Only at failure should you come all the way up and rest for a few seconds so that you can perform a few more repetitions.
  - When the lumbar muscles tire, maintaining the slight natural arch of the back is difficult. As a result, the spine will start to curve. When this happens, reduce the range of motion so that you can always keep your back straight. The same problem occurs with the good morning variation described next.
  
**Variation**
Instead of holding the weight with your hands, you can put the bar on your upper back just as you do with squats and bend as in the standard stiff-leg deadlift just described. This variation is called a good morning. This variation will target the lower body more while reducing the involvement of the upper-body muscles, especially the lats, the lower trapezius, and the arms.

![Deadlift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/deadlift.png)

![Deadlift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/deadlift1.png)


## 2.Lying Leg Curl
The lying leg curl belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the knee joints are mobilized. As a result, it recruits only the hamstrings and part of the calves.

#### How to Do It
Place your ankles beneath the pad of the moving arm of the machine and lie facedown on the machine. Using your hamstrings, bring the pad up to your buttocks. At the top of the movement, hold the contraction for two seconds and bring your feet back toward the floor. repeat before you have completely straightened your legs.

**Pro**
  - This exercise really isolates the backs of the thighs, which increases your awareness of these hard-to-feel muscles.
  
**Cons**
  - The leg extension is used to increase the definition of each head of the quadriceps. The glutes are not recruited at all; therefore, if glute development is your main goal, this is not the best exercise for you.

**Tips**
  - Put your hands on your quadriceps to better feel the contraction.
  - Don’t arch your lower back in an attempt to create a stronger quadriceps contraction.

**Leg Curl Variations**
 1. Dumbbell Variations
Holding a dumbbell between your feet renders the exercise much more productive. An incline bench is even more effective as shown below:

**Seated Leg Curl**
The seated leg curl belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise categorybecause only the knee joints are mobilized. As a result, it recruits only the hamstrings and part of the calves.

###### How to Do It
Sit in the machine and place your ankles on top of the pad of the moving arm of the machine. Using your hamstrings, bring the pad down toward your buttocks. At the bottom of the movement, hold the contraction for two seconds and bring your feet back up. Repeat.

**Pro**
  - There is a very powerful contraction of the hamstrings making it the best machine exercise for this muscle
  
**Cons**
  - With some machines, it is simply not possible to move the torso forward, even slightly.

**Tips**
  - Perform this exercise in a slow and controlled manner, not explosively. Do not straighten your legs completely in the stretched position so that you maintain continuous tension in the hamstrings.
  - Don’t arch your lower back as you contract your hamstrings.
  
 **Advanced Variation**
Even though this is technically an isolation exercise, the seated leg curl is a multiple-joint exercise if you move your torso forward as you bring your legs down. As you contract your hamstrings, they become progressively weaker, which forces you to arch your lower back. This demonstrates the physiological absurdity of staying firmly seated during the entire exercise. By moving your torso forward as your legs move backward, your hamstrings will become progressively stronger instead of weaker as the repetitions go on. Your range of motion in the contracted position will be greater, and there will be no arching of the lower back. The farther you bring your legs under you, the more you lean forward. While the legs are bending to 90 degrees, the torso is bending to 45 degrees. The reverse happens when you extend your legs.
